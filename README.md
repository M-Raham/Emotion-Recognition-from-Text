# 💬 Emotion Recognition from Text

## 🧠 Overview

This project is focused on detecting **emotions from textual data** using a fine-tuned **BERT** model. Given any sentence, the model predicts one or more emotional states such as **joy**, **anger**, **sadness**, and more. It is trained on the **GoEmotions** dataset and runs through a simple command-line interface for quick predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 Multi-label emotion detection
- 🔹 Fine-tuned BERT transformer model
- 🔹 Trained on Google's GoEmotions dataset
- 🔹 CLI-based emotion prediction
- 🔹 Auto-download of trained model (only once)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python**
- 🤗 **Transformers (Hugging Face)**
- 🔥 **PyTorch**
- 🧪 **Scikit-learn**, **NumPy**
- ☁️ **Google Colab** (for training)
- 🌐 **Requests** (for downloading model)

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Raham/Emotion-Recognition-from-Text.git
cd Emotion-Recognition-from-Text
```

### 2️⃣ Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install torch transformers requests
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Emotion Predictor

```bash
python emotion_predictor.py
```

- 🛑 The script will **automatically download** the trained model if not found locally.
- 💬 Enter your text, and the predicted emotions will be displayed.
