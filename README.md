Got it! Here's a `README.md` for your **Emotion Recognition from Text** project using the same structure and style as your Fake News Detection README:

# Emotion Recognition from Text üí¨üß†

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on recognizing **emotions from text** using a fine-tuned BERT model. The model can identify multiple emotions such as **joy**, **anger**, **sadness**, and more from a given sentence. It is trained on the **GoEmotions** dataset and provides predictions using a simple command-line interface.

## üöÄ Features

- Multi-label emotion classification
- Trained using the GoEmotions dataset
- Fine-tuned BERT model for high accuracy
- Python script for user-friendly emotion predictions
- Automatic model download and setup

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **Transformers** (Hugging Face library for BERT)
- **PyTorch** (For deep learning model)
- **Requests** (For downloading model)
- **Scikit-learn, NumPy** (Supporting ML libraries)
- **Google Colab** (For training)

## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Raham/Emotion-Recognition-from-Text.git
cd Emotion-Recognition-from-Text
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch transformers requests
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Emotion Predictor:

```bash
python emotion_predictor.py
```

- The script will **automatically download** the trained model from Google Drive (only once).
- It will then prompt you to enter a sentence and display the detected emotions.

## üìä Dataset

- The model is trained on the **GoEmotions dataset** by Google Research.
- The dataset includes 58 emotion labels across 200k+ Reddit comments.
- Preprocessing and training were performed using BERT in the `emotion_classification_colab.ipynb` notebook.

## üìÇ Files Included

- `emotion_classification_colab.ipynb` ‚Äì Model training notebook using GoEmotions.
- `emotion_predictor.py` ‚Äì Script to load the model and predict emotions from user input.

## üìå Future Enhancements

- Web app interface using Streamlit or Flask
- Deploy the model as an API
- Expand to multilingual emotion detection
- Add confidence scores and emotion visualization

## ü§ù Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Feel free to fork the repo and improve the project.
