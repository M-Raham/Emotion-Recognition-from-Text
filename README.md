# Emotion Recognition from Text üß†üí¨

This project is a simple yet powerful emotion recognition system that classifies **emotions from a given sentence** using a fine-tuned **BERT model**. It leverages the **GoEmotions dataset** and Hugging Face Transformers.

---

## üìÅ Files in This Repository

### 1. `emotion_classification_colab.ipynb`
- This Jupyter notebook was used to **train the model**.
- It uses the **GoEmotions dataset** for multi-label emotion classification.
- The model was fine-tuned using **BERT**.
- After training, the model is saved to a `.zip` file (`my_emotion_model.zip`) for later use.

### 2. `emotion_predictor.py`
- A standalone Python script that:
  - Downloads the trained model from Google Drive (if not already present).
  - Loads the model and tokenizer.
  - Accepts user input for emotion prediction.
  - Displays detected emotions and top emotion probabilities.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Raham/Emotion-Recognition-from-Text.git
cd Emotion-Recognition-from-Text
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install transformers torch requests
```

### 3. Run the Predictor Script

```bash
python emotion_predictor.py
```

- The script will **automatically download the model** from Google Drive.
- Once downloaded, it will prompt you to enter a sentence.

## üí° Example Usage

```
Enter a sentence: I‚Äôm feeling so proud and accomplished today!
Predicted Emotions: ['pride', 'joy']
Top 4 Emotions (most likely): ['pride', 'joy', 'love', 'gratitude']
```

To exit:

```
Enter a sentence: exit
Goodbye!
```

## üßæ Notes

- If the auto-download doesn't work, you can manually download the model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwqHzeop5TbqpU7Gn8G2vG9MBHV0Wt2f/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the same folder as the script.
- The `.zip` file will be extracted automatically and used for prediction.
